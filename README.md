# Multiclass Brain Tumor Classification

> Group A5

## Introduction
 A brain tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal cells in the brain. Many types of brain tumors exist, some being cancerous and others benign. Benign tumor cells rarely invade neighboring cells and have a slow progression rate. Malignant cells readily attack neighboring cells, have fuzzy borders, and rapid progression rates. The main tumor kinds are primary and metastatic. How quickly a brain tumor grows can vary, it depending on their location they are represented by different nomenclature. This project focuses on the development of a robust algorithm to distinguish between three tumors - Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary. We built an app in Python that can detect the brain tumor type.

## Motivations
> â€œWhat all of us have to do is to make sure we are using AI in a way that is for the benefit of humanity, not to the detriment of humanity." - Tim Cook, CEO Apple

I believe in data science for good!

## Alternate Approaches
1. Unsupervised learning - We may not be able to directly implement this method directly, because we have labeled data.
2. Transfer Learning - Is there already a trained model that could be used to train on the data!?
3. Pytorch vs Tensorflow
